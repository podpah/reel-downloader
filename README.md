# Reel Downloader
Reel Downloader is a simple bookmarklet that allows you to easily save your instagram reels. I built it because I tried a few extensions and they didn't work so here we are.

You can get it by dragging and dropping this on your bookmarks: <br>
[Click here](https://podpah.github.io/reel-downloader/) - Github doesn't support a tags in markdown unfortunately so this takes you to the tag  <br>
You can also copy and paste [bookmarklet](bookmarklet.js) into a bookmark's URL if this doesn't work for you

# Usage
You just click the bookmark once to run it. It'll create a new tab on the video file. <br>
> [!WARNING]  
> Instagram changes how reels are rendered often so this might break
